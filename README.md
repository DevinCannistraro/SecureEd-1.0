<b><u>ISWA Setup:</u></b>

Step 1: Installation</u></b>

Clone the repository, or simple download and unzip it to the directory of your choosing.

<b><u>Step 2: Startup</u></b>


In the ISWA folder, open startup.bin. This will open the web server in a command prompt, and then it will open the webapp in your default browser.
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Do NOT close the prompt that opens up with the web server, as that will close the server and reset your progress.


<b><u>Step 3: Closing the web server</u></b>

Simply close the Windows command prompt, and the web server will be closed immediately. Restarting the webserver is as simple as opening startup.bat again, but note that it will reset the database automatically when you do.
